This work is built on the foundations laid by Amazon Webservice SDK asynchronous version for .net 4.0 by David Pio (https://github.com/puffpio) and can be found at: https://github.com/puffpio/awssdk-async

The sole purpose of this library is to support asynchronous communication between Windows Phone 7 and Amazon Simple Storage Services (S3). Since the windows phone 7.x supports a minimal implementation of various web request objects a need for such a library was deemed essential.

The objectives of this work are:

1. Support GET request to Amazon S3 server
2. Support PUT request to Amazon S3 server
3. Support the creation of signed URL for content from Amazon S3

To build this library, it requires .Net 4 and Microsoft Silverlight for Window Phone Toolkit.

I have also blogged about this code at:
